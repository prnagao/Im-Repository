page2_fig_11_1.jpg,2,"Figure 11.1. Low-power features of carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma (arrows) is seen infiltrating through-out benign glands (arrowheads) in this core biopsy specimen. The malignant glands are often back to back and have relatively denser cytoplasm, no basal layer, and straight luminal borders.",True
page2_fig_11_2.jpg,2,Figure 11.2. Benign prostate glands. These glands have a distinct basal cell layer underlying the ­epithelial cells (arrowhead) and papillary fronds in the lumen (arrow). Corpora amylacea (CA) are ­concentrically laminated concretions associated with benign glands.,True
page3_fig_11_3.jpg,3,"Figure 11.3. High-power features of carcinoma. Malignant glands show distinct nucleoli (arrowhead), sharp luminal borders, and an absence of basal cells. Benign glands are seen adjacent to the cancer (arrow).",True
page3_fig_11_4.jpg,3,Figure 11.4. Perineural invasion. A nerve (N) is identified by the undulating axons and nerve sheath nuclei. Malignant glands are seen nearly surrounding the nerve (arrow).,True
page4_fig_11_5.jpg,4,"Figure 11.5. Gleason pattern 3. Individual, well-formed malignant glands make up pattern 3 cancer. Blue mucin, often associated with carcinoma, is present (arrow).",True
page5_fig_11_6.jpg,5,Figure 11.6. Gleason pattern 4. The area of cribriform growth (arrow) and adjacent fused glands is typical of pattern 4.,True
page5_fig_11_7.jpg,5,"Figure 11.7. Gleason pattern 5. Individual malignant cells, without evidence of gland formation, are typical of pattern 5. The individual cells still cytologically resemble well-differentiated carcinoma, with round nuclei and prominent nucleoli (circle).",True
page6_fig_11_8.jpg,6,"Figure 11.8. High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. Although the papillary infoldings resemble benign prostate, the nuclei are larger and darker and show occasional prominent nucleoli (arrow). Basal cells are still present (arrowhead).",True
page7_fig_11_9.jpg,7,"Figure 11.9. Atrophy. These glands appear hyperchromatic and infiltrative. However, the low cuboidal cells with attenuated cytoplasm (arrow) and angular gland profiles are typical of benign atrophy. Corpora amylacea are present (arrowhead).",True
page8_fig_11_10.jpg,8,"Figure 11.10. Basal cell hyperplasia. This proliferation of cells, some with prominent nucleoli (arrow), is actually an expanded basal cell layer. Comparison with benign epithelium (arrowhead) shows the rela-tively pale and grayish nuclei of the basal cells.",True
page8_fig_11_11.jpg,8,"Figure 11.11. Radiation atypia in benign prostate. There is scattered and random nuclear pleomor-phism (arrow). Enlarged nuclei classically have dense, uniform, smudgy chromatin.",True
page9_fig_11_12.jpg,9,"Figure 11.12. Seminal vesicle in a biopsy specimen. There are scattered large, hyperchromatic, and crowded nuclei in this gland (arrowhead). However, golden pigment is visible in the cytoplasm (arrow), identifying this as seminal vesicle.",True
page10_fig_11_13.jpg,10,Figure 11.13. Low-power view of radical prostatectomy sections. Each cross section of prostate is cut into quadrants to fit into cassettes. The neurovascular bundles (NVB) are found at the posterolateral bor-der of the prostate. The verumontanum points anteriorly.,True
page11_fig_11_14.jpg,11,"Figure 11.14. Extraprostatic extension. Malignant glands are seen wrapping around a nerve (arrow) adjacent to extraprostatic fat, diagnostic of focal extraprostatic extension. The margin, seen as the ink at the top of the photograph, is negative.",True
page12_fig_11_15.jpg,12,"Figure 11.15. Ductal adenocarcinoma. In this variant, the tumor cells have tall columnar morphology. The nuclei still resemble conventional prostatic adenocarcinoma.",True
